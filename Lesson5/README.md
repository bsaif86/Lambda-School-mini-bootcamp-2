# Lecture 5 Notes - Statements, Variables, and For Loops from JavaScript
## [@?m??s](https://youtu.be/UwNMelsm28Y?t=?m??s) LECTURE STARTS

- PROMPTS:
```js
prompt("What is your name?");
```

- VARIABLES:
```js
var name = prompt("What is your name?");

console.log(name);

// write it to the web page
document("My name is Patrick")
// use document with a variable
document.write(name);
```

- Note per CodePen.io: "document.write can be a form of eval. ([Google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=JS%20Hint%20document.write%20can%20be%20a%20form%20of%20eval.))"

- DATA TYPES:
Strings = text
Numbers (ints, floats, etc)
Operators e.g. add multiply subtract divide modulus (remainder), i.e. + * - / %
...Booleans

- Assignment vs equivalensy operators ==  & ===
= assignment

== equivalent not including type
5 == "5" is true

=== equivalent including type
5 == "5" is false
5 === 5 is true

- FOR LOOPS:

- IF, ELSE IF, ELSE

Homework: basic math, for loop and fizz buzz!
