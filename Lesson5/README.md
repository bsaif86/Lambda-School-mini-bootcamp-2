# Lecture 5 Notes - Statements, Variables, and For Loops from JavaScript
## [@1m51s](https://youtu.be/UwNMelsm28Y?t=1m51s) LECTURE STARTS

- PROMPTS:
  ```js
  prompt("What is your name?");
  ```

- VARIABLES:
  ```js
  var name = prompt("What is your name?");

  console.log(name);

  // write it to the web page
  document("My name is Patrick")
  // use document with a variable
  document.write(name);
  ```

  - Note per CodePen.io: "document.write can be a form of eval. ([Google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=JS%20Hint%20document.write%20can%20be%20a%20form%20of%20eval.))"


- DATA TYPES:
  - Strings = text
  - Numbers (ints, floats, etc)
  - Operators e.g. add multiply subtract divide modulus (remainder), i.e. + * - / %
  - (...Booleans?)


- ASSIGNMENT = vs EQUIVALENCY OPERATORS ==  & ===
  - = assignment
  - == equivalent not including type
    - 5 == "5" is true
  - === equivalent including type
    - 5 === "5" is false
    - 5 === 5 is true


- FOR LOOPS:

- Homework: basic math, for loop and fizz buzz!
