# Homework #6

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions
		- Functions are I/O devices; constructions which take an input value, do something based on that value and output the result. You put something in and something comes out. Often, what comes out is something different than what you put in. Functions do not require an input, sometimes merely invoking a function will result in an output. (See: Pachinko)
	* Parameters
		- Parameters are the abstract values which functions will hypothetically act upon.
	* Arguments
		- Arguments are the actual values passed in as the parameters which a function is constructed to act upon.
	* `if` statements
		- Conditional control flows of the form, "if a condition is met, then an action is performed." These can be extended in the instance that the initial condition is not met, i.e. " if..., then..., if not, then something else." "If" statement conditions are reduced to their Boolean(ish) state such that "if true, then x; if false, then y (or proceed to another if/else-if condition)." When the conditions are not met, an unconditional "else" is defined such that there is an action resulting when none of the preceding conditions are satisfied.

	- Done √

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.
