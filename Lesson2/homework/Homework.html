    </p>
    <p>[34] Hanc ego cum teneam sententiam, quid est cur verear, ne ad eam non possim accommodare Torquatos nostros? quos tu paulo ante cum memoriter, tum etiam erga nos amice et benivole collegisti, nec me tamen laudandis maioribus meis corrupisti nec segniorem ad respondendum reddidisti. quorum facta quem ad modum, quaeso, interpretaris? sicine eos censes aut in armatum hostem impetum fecisse aut in liberos atque in sanguinem suum tam crudelis fuisse, nihil ut de utilitatibus, nihil ut de commodis suis cogitarent? at id ne ferae quidem faciunt, ut ita ruant itaque turbent, ut earum motus et impetus quo pertineant non intellegamus, tu tam egregios viros censes tantas res gessisse sine causa?
    </p>
    <p>[35] Quae fuerit causa, mox videro; interea hoc tenebo, si ob aliquam causam ista, quae sine dubio praeclara sunt, fecerint, virtutem iis per se ipsam causam non fuisse. -- Torquem detraxit hosti. -- Et quidem se texit, ne interiret. -- At magnum periculum adiit. -- In oculis quidem exercitus. -- Quid ex eo est consecutus? -- Laudem et caritatem, quae sunt vitae sine metu degendae praesidia firmissima. -- Filium morte multavit. -- Si sine causa, nollem me ab eo ortum, tam inportuno tamque crudeli; sin, ut dolore suo sanciret militaris imperii disciplinam exercitumque in gravissimo bello animadversionis metu contineret, saluti prospexit civium, qua intellegebat contineri suam. atque haec ratio late patet.
    </p>
    <p>[36] In quo enim maxime consuevit iactare vestra se oratio, tua praesertim, qui studiose antiqua persequeris, claris et fortibus viris commemorandis eorumque factis non emolumento aliquo, sed ipsius honestatis decore laudandis, id totum evertitur eo delectu rerum, quem modo dixi, constituto, ut aut voluptates omittantur maiorum voluptatum adipiscendarum causa aut dolores suscipiantur maiorum dolorum effugiendorum gratia.
    </p>
    <p>[37] Sed de clarorum hominum factis illustribus et gloriosis satis hoc loco dictum sit. erit enim iam de omnium virtutum cursu ad voluptatem proprius disserendi locus. nunc autem explicabo, voluptas ipsa quae qualisque sit, ut tollatur error omnis imperitorum intellegaturque ea, quae voluptaria, delicata, mollis habeatur disciplina, quam gravis, quam continens, quam severa sit. Non enim hanc solam sequimur, quae suavitate aliqua naturam ipsam movet et cum iucunditate quadam percipitur sensibus, sed maximam voluptatem illam habemus, quae percipitur omni dolore detracto, nam quoniam, cum privamur dolore, ipsa liberatione et vacuitate omnis molestiae gaudemus, omne autem id, quo gaudemus, voluptas est, ut omne, quo offendimur, dolor, doloris omnis privatio recte nominata est voluptas. ut enim, cum cibo et potione fames sitisque depulsa est, ipsa detractio molestiae consecutionem affert voluptatis, sic in omni re doloris amotio successionem efficit voluptatis.

    <p>[33] But the truth of them, and they are accusing and he is just hatred, worthy of the commander, which the flattery of her the present of pleasure accusantium of them deal corruptly, of these pains, and for which he troubles excepturi they are, blinded by the desire not to betake himself, and in the same they are to blame, and who exercise an office they deserted the general weakness of spirit, that is, of his labor and painful. And this is the difference between simple and easy. For your free time, it is us the option of choosing a man and an unmarried, and when nothing prevents it, the less it is, that which is most pleasing to God, we may be able to do, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. the duties of the debts or the obligations of the times and in certain circumstances and they often come to pass, that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. was selected for these matters to this, therefore, is obliged to heed a wise man, that he should either he rejects pleasures to secure other greater or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

    <p>[34] I have brought about the sentence, when I hold you, I am afraid, what is it, why, I can not answer to it, to adjust the Torquatos in our hearts? of whom you are a little previously, when the memory, as well as my friend, too, and with good will towards us, you have brought together, and corrupted, nor to my forefathers and weaker at the time to respond, nor hast restored to me, however, with the praise of. of whom she became how it is, I beg you, not to interpret? the violence of an armed enemy, do you think of them, or in do ye suffer in the children, and for this measure, or to have been so hasty in the blood shed on it, nothing to complain of the advantages that they were to think nothing to complain of in the interest of their own? yet they do with wild beasts at To prevent this, if I may so they can make, therefore, be confused by, that they may not understand that, of them the movement of the direction and force of what they are for, thou who art so you think so many men of eminence who had conducted their operations without a cause?

    <p>[36] For he of whom the most has been accustomed to toss the limits your prayer, your own, especially, who diligently the ancient thou follow, expressed in clear, the warriors, men of the commemoration of their deeds thou dost not an advantage to any one, but has also the honor, the glory of with the praise, the whole matter is swept out by the selection of events which, as I said, been established, and that he should either of our ancestors, of sorrows, of pleasures, to attain to the cause of, or tortures, are admitted to the pleasures of the effugiendorum be left undone, the grace of our ancestors.

    <p>[37] But the deeds of famous people for the aged enough that this was spoken. I now speak of the pleasure of their own, there shall be a place for discussing the course of all the virtues. now, however, explain the treatment of the pleasure itself which is a, this error is altogether ignorant intellegaturque it might be taken away, which is a voluptuous, delicate, soft, there should be training, what a heavy burden, than a continent, how severe it is. For it is not in this case alone we follow, which is the charm of some of the nature of the so moves it, and with a certain attractiveness is perceived by the senses, but has the greatest pleasure which we have, which is derived by any pain, has been set aside, for it is that, while we but our pain, it is the liberation of the, and the vacuity of all the discomfort we feel, while every thing, with which we rejoice, the pleasure is to say, that of all that which offends us, the pain, the absence of all pain is the pleasure of what we rightly call. in order that, when it is being driven away, with food and drink, hunger and thirst, brings about the attainment of what has been said of pleasure, discomfort, so the succession of the removal of the causes of pain in any thing of pleasure.

    <p><a href="http://www.openculture.com/2015/03/the-story-of-lorem-ipsum.html"Dolorem Ipsum</a>, “pain in and of itself,” sums up the tortuous feeling of trying to render some of Cicero’s complex, verbose sentences into English. Doing so with tolerable proficiency is, for some of us, “great pleasure” indeed.
